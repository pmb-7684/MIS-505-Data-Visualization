# MIS-505-Data-Visualization
Tableau

For this final project we had to explain "what you found........" which is different from other projects. Looking at this project, I see opportunites where I could have elaborated on a point.  

Each student had to select a data set to explore from a list of twenty options. I decided to use the same data from the City of Chicago to create visualizations to tell a story during the pandemic.  The City of Chicagoâ€™s Data Portal documents crime in the city from 2001 to the present.  Data from 2019 and 2020 was selected.  Bar, line, slope charts, and tables were created. In addition, geospatial mapping was used to explore crime according to the location (neighborhood) a person lived.

The final Tableau package is over 100 KB, so I am unable to upload it to github. I am also unable to load the data sets seperately. The Chicago 2019 and 2020 data files are 60,492 KB and 28,679 KB, respectively. The covid data is 2 KB.
