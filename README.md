# MIS-505-Data-Visualization
Tableau

For the final project each student had to select data to explore. I decided to use the same data set from the City of Chicago to create visualizations to tell a story.  The City of Chicagoâ€™s Data Portal contains information about crime in Chicago in 2019 and 2020.  For this project, I created bar, line, slope charts. In addition to geospatial to explore crime according to the location a person lived.
